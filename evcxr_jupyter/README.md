# EvCxR Jupyter Kernel

A [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Kernel for the Rust programming language.

## Installation

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```sh
sudo apt install libzmq3-dev jupyter-notebook
cargo install evcxr_jupyter
evcxr_jupyter --install
```

### Mac OS X

install jupyter or jupyterlab (eg. via anaconda)

```sh
brew install zeromq pkg-config
cargo install evcxr_jupyter
evcxr_jupyter --install
```

## Usage notes

* Functions, structs etc need to all be declared pub, otherwise they can't be
  referenced from later cells.
* See see what variables you've got defined, type ":vars".
* Don't ask Jupyter to "interrupt kernel", it won't work. Rust threads can't be
  interrupted.
* If your code panics, any non-copy variables referenced by the code being run
  will be lost. Variables with Copy types and variables not referenced by the
  code are preserved.
* If your code segfaults (e.g. due to buggy unsafe code), aborts, exits etc, the
  process in which the code runs will be restarted. All variables will be lost.
  
## Custom output

The last expression in a cell gets printed. By default, we'll use the debug
formatter to emit plain text. If you'd like, you can provide a function to show
your type (or someone else's type) as HTML (or an image). To do this, the type
needs to implement a method called ```evcxr_display``` which should then print
one or more mime-typed blocks to stdout. Each block starts with a line
containing BEGIN\_EVCXR\_OUTPUT followed by the mime type, then a newline, the
content then ends with a line containing EVCXR\_END\_CONTENT.

For example, the following shows how you might provide a custom display function for a
type Matrix. You can copy this code into a Jupyter notebook cell to try it out.

```rust
use std::fmt::Debug;
pub struct Matrix<T> {pub values: Vec<T>, pub row_size: usize}
impl<T: Debug> Matrix<T> {
    pub fn evcxr_display(&self) {
        let mut html = String::new();
        html.push_str("<table>");
        for r in 0..(self.values.len() / self.row_size) {
            html.push_str("<tr>");
            for c in 0..self.row_size {
                html.push_str("<td>");
                html.push_str(&format!("{:?}", self.values[r * self.row_size + c]));
                html.push_str("</td>");
            }
            html.push_str("</tr>");            
        }
        html.push_str("</table>");
        println!("EVCXR_BEGIN_CONTENT text/html\n{}\nEVCXR_END_CONTENT", html);
    }
}
let m = Matrix {values: vec![1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], row_size: 3};
m
```

It's probably a good idea to either print the whole block at once, or to lock
stdout then print the block. This should ensure that nothing else prints to
stdout at the same time (at least no other Rust code).

If the content is binary (e.g. mime type "image/png") then it should be base64
encoded.

## Uninstall

```sh
evcxr_jupyter --uninstall
cargo uninstall evcxr_jupyter
```
