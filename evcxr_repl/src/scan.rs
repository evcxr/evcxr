//! Sadly, `syn` and friends only handle valid rust -- or at least, `syn` tells
//! us that an input is invalid, but cannot determine the difference between
//! inputs that are invalid due to incompleteness and those that are completely
//! invalid as it stands. (This seems due to the fact that rust's lexical
//! primitive is not the token, but the token *tree*, which guarantees brackets
//! are properly nested.
//!
//! I looked around and short of writing a parser, nothing on crates.io helps.
//! So, this is a minimal scanner that attempts to find if input is obviously
//! unclosed. It handles:
//!
//! - Various kinds of brackets: `()`, `[]`, `{}`.
//!
//! - Strings, including raw strings with preceeding hashmarks (e.g.
//!   `r##"foo"##`)
//!
//! - Comments, including nested block comments. `/*/` is (properly) not treated
//!   as a self-closing comment, but the opening of another nesting level.
//!
//! - char/byte literals, but not very well, as they're confusing with
//!   lifetimes. It does just well enough to know that '{' doesn't open a curly
//!   brace, or to get tripped up by '\u{}'
//!
//! It doesn't handle
//!
//! - Closure arguments like `|x|`.
//!
//! - Generic paremeters like `<` (it's possible we could catch them in the
//!   turbofish case but probably not worth it).
//!
//! - Incomplete expressions/statements which aren't inside some other of a
//!   nesting, e.g. `foo +` is clearly incomplete, but we don't detect it unless
//!   it has parens around it.
//!
//! In general the goal here was to parse enough not to get confused by cases
//! that would lead us to think complete input was incomplete. This requires
//! handling strings, comments, etc, as they are allowed to have a "{" in it
//! which we'd otherwise think keeps the whole line open.
//!
//! Note that from here, it should be possible to use syn to actually parse
//! things, but that's left alone for now.
